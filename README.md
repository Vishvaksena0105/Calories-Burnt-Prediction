# Calories Burnt Prediction

**Project Code:** [GitHub Link](https://github.com/Vishvaksena0105/Calories-Burnt-Prediction/blob/main/Calories_Burnt_Prediction.ipynb)  
**Dataset:** [CSV File](https://github.com/Vishvaksena0105/Calories-Burnt-Prediction/blob/main/calories.csv)

## 🧠 Overview

This project focuses on predicting the number of calories burnt during physical activity using machine learning algorithms. By analyzing features such as gender, age, height, weight, duration, heart rate, and body temperature, the model aims to provide accurate calorie burn predictions to assist in fitness and health planning.

## 📊 Dataset

**Source:** The dataset used is in CSV format (`calories.csv`).

**Features:**
- Gender
- Age
- Height (cm)
- Weight (kg)
- Duration (in minutes)
- Heart Rate
- Body Temperature (°C)

**Target:**
- `Calories_Burnt` — The number of calories burned during the activity.

## 🗂️ Project Structure
